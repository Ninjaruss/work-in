# Work-In Website
A hobby project my friend and I developed between Summer 2022 - Summer 2023 intending to support small businesses with organizing work schedules for employees.

## Members
Paul Marquez - Project Manager  
Russell Azucenas - Full Stack Developer  


## Project Description
A web application that allows companies to create work schedules with their employees. Utilizes the MERN stack (MongoDB, Expressjs, React, Node.js). 

## What I Learned
- The difficulty in implementing a calendar from an external API (https://ui.toast.com/tui-calendar)
- Ensuring data is passed from the database into the local client's calendar (very little details in the documentation on the Toast UI calendar).
- Working with a project manager to ensure requirements for the application are met and detailing specifics on needs
- Implementation of proper JWT token authentication for logins
- Designing the data structure for the calendars and employee data and including core functions to obtain and update data
- Received additional practice in designing a website's frontend
